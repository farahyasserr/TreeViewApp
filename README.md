# Overview
This project is a React Native app featuring a reusable and scalable Tree View component. The Tree View component is designed to handle any number of levels in the data hierarchy and adjusts its display accordingly.

# Features
- Reusable and scalable Tree View component.
- Supports any number of levels in the data hierarchy.
- Allows users to select items from the tree view.
- Selecting an item also selects all its children (if any).
- Unselecting an item also unselects the item and all its children (if any).

# Usage
The Tree View component can be easily reused by importing the component and passing the necessary data.

# Unit Testing
This project includes unit testing using Jest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the Tree View component.

```bash
yarn test
```

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn ios
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
